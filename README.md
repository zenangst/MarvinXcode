## Install

#### Compiled Version

* This is on my TODO-list, stay tuned.

#### Build from Source

* Build the Xcode project. The plug-in will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. 

* Relaunch Xcode.

To uninstall, just remove the plugin from `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins` and restart Xcode.

A big shout out goes out to Benoît Bourdon [@benoitsan](https://github.com/benoitsan).
He made [BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode](https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode) which includes private Xcode headers and some convenience methods that is being used in this project.
Without his tremendous work this might not have ever happened.
